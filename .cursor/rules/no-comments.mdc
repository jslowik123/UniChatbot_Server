# No Comments Rule

When writing or modifying code, do not add any comments to the code. The code should be self-explanatory through clear variable names, function names, and structure.

Focus on making the code clear and readable without relying on comments for explanation. If something needs explanation, refactor it to be more self-explanatory instead.

## Examples:

### Avoid:
```python
# Calculate the total price with tax
total = price + (price * tax_rate)
```

### Prefer:
```python
total_price_with_tax = base_price + (base_price * tax_rate)
```
