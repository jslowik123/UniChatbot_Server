# Stay Focused on Described Problems

Only modify code that is directly related to the specific problem or task described by the user. Do not make additional changes or improvements to other parts of the code, even if they seem beneficial.

Focus exclusively on addressing the specific issue raised, without expanding scope or making unrelated adjustments.

## Examples:

### If asked to fix a calculation bug:
- DO: Fix only the specific calculation logic
- DON'T: Refactor surrounding code or change formatting

### If asked to add a new feature:
- DO: Implement exactly what was requested
- DON'T: Add extra features or modify existing functionality not mentioned
